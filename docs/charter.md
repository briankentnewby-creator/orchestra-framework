# ORCHESTRA Governance Charter

This charter defines the structure, roles, and processes of the ORCHESTRA governance framework. It is designed to support decentralized, accountable, and adaptive coordination across multi-stakeholder ecosystems.

## 1. Purpose

To enable transparent, scalable governance that balances decentralization, agility, and compliance — empowering stakeholders to fund, coordinate, and execute shared goals.

## 2. Guiding Principles

- **Openness**: All decisions, rationale, and records are public.
- **Proportional Voice**: Influence scales with contribution or representation.
- **Subsidiarity**: Decisions are made at the lowest competent level.
- **Transparency & Auditability**: Verifiable records of decisions and treasury activity.
- **Safety & Continuity**: Emergency processes and risk controls.
- **Iteration**: Governance evolves through regular review.

## 3. Governance Structure

ORCHESTRA is an acronym for the core governance bodies:

- **O: Oversight Council** — Strategic guardians
- **R: Representative Assembly** — Broad legitimacy
- **C: Coordinating Board** — Operational oversight
- **H: Heads of Program** — Project execution
- **E: Expert Panels** — Technical review
- **S: Stewardship Committee** — Treasury management
- **T: Transparency Office** — Reporting & compliance
- **R/A: Resolution & Appeals** — Dispute resolution

Each body has defined roles, powers, and escalation paths. See [README](../README.md) for summaries.
## 4. Proposal Flow

All decisions follow a structured lifecycle:

1. **Idea Submission** — Anyone may submit an idea or RFC to the public forum.
2. **Drafting** — A sponsor prepares a formal proposal using the standard template.
3. **Review** — Expert Panels and relevant bodies provide feedback and endorsements.
4. **Voting** — Proposal is submitted to the appropriate body for approval.
5. **Implementation** — Upon approval, execution is delegated to responsible leads.
6. **Monitoring** — Progress is tracked and reported publicly.
7. **Post-Mortem** — Outcomes and lessons learned are documented.

## 5. Decision Types

Each proposal is categorized by impact and routed accordingly:

- **Operational**: Day-to-day decisions, handled by Coordinating Board.
- **Financial**: Budget allocations, treasury disbursements.
- **Strategic**: Long-term direction, constitutional amendments.
- **Technical**: Protocol upgrades, security changes.
- **Emergency**: Time-sensitive or risk-critical actions.
- **Dispute Resolution**: Appeals, ethics, or conflict mediation.

Each type has defined thresholds, quorum rules, and escalation paths.
